                        <h2>About the Book</h2>
                        <p>It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated
                            by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting
                            popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best
                            examples of the
                            literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have
                            been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the
                            fantasy
                            genre.

                        Turtle. The three of them talk and dance and play a game, until the Gryphon spirits Alice away

                        refuses.
                        The Queen orders the cards to attack Alice, but Alice is unafraid.</p>
